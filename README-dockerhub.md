# Kaitai Struct: visualizer

This is a console visualizer for the [Kaitai Struct](https://kaitai.io/) project.

Kaitai Struct is a declarative language used for describe various
binary data structures, laid out in files or in memory: i.e. binary
file formats, network stream packet formats, etc.

The main idea is that a particular format is described in Kaitai
Struct language (`.ksy` file) and then can be compiled with
`ksc` into source files in one of the supported programming
languages. These modules will contain generated code for a parser
that can read the described data structure from a file / stream and provide
access to it using a nice, easy-to-understand API.

See the [Kaitai Struct homepage](https://kaitai.io/) for details on `.ksy` files and general usage patterns.

## Downloading and installing

### Requirements _(this Docker image has everything bundled inside)_

- [ksc](https://kaitai.io/#download) — `kaitai-struct-compiler`
- [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/install/)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) (latest Ruby 3.x recommended,
  at least Ruby 2.4 required)

### From RubyGems repository

Kaitai Struct visualizer is written in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) and is
available [on RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/gems/kaitai-struct-visualizer). Thus,
you'll need Ruby installed on your box and then you can just run:

```shell
gem install kaitai-struct-visualizer
```

---

You can use `ksv --version` to check what versions of `ksv` and its dependencies are installed, for example:

```console
$ ksv --version
kaitai-struct-visualizer 0.7
kaitai-struct-compiler 0.11
kaitai-struct 0.11 (Kaitai Struct runtime library for Ruby)
```

The versions of `kaitai-struct-compiler` and `kaitai-struct` should match. If not, see https://kaitai.io/#download for instructions how to install the latest version of `kaitai-struct-compiler` and/or use `gem update kaitai-struct` to update the [kaitai-struct](https://rubygems.org/gems/kaitai-struct) gem if needed.

### Source code

If you're interested in developing the visualizer itself, you can check
out the source code from the [kaitai_struct_visualizer](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer) GitHub repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer.git
```

Then run `bundle install` to install dependencies. After that, you can run [`bin/ksv`](bin/ksv) or [`bin/ksdump`](bin/ksdump) right away (without having to install the `kaitai-struct-visualizer` gem first), which makes development easier.

## Usage

There are two executables provided by this package:

* `ksv` — interactive console visualizer with GUI
* `ksdump` — command-line tool for dumping parsed data in JSON, XML or YAML format to standard output (_stdout_)

The basic usage is similar for both programs:

```shell
ksv <binary-file> <ksy-file>... | <rb-file>
```

For `ksdump`, it may be useful to change the output format with the `-f` option (the default is `yaml`) and redirect the output to a file so that your terminal is not flooded with thousands of lines (for larger input files):

```shell
ksdump -f json <binary-file> <ksy-file>... > output.json
```

### Running with Docker

This project is also available via the [kaitai/ksv](https://hub.docker.com/r/kaitai/ksv) image on Docker Hub. The default entrypoint is `ksv` (the interactive visualizer):

```shell
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/share" kaitai/ksv <binary-file> <ksy-file>
```

You can specify `ksdump` as the entrypoint like this (and note that we don't need the `-it` flags anymore because `ksdump` is not interactive — omitting them in fact allows you to distinguish the `ksdump`'s output to _stdout_ and _stderr_, see [this comment](https://github.com/kaitai-io/kaitai_struct_visualizer/issues/56#issuecomment-1666629764)):

```shell
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/share" --entrypoint ksdump kaitai/ksv -f json <binary-file> <ksy-file> > output.json
```

---

Building the Docker image locally:
```shell
docker build . --tag docker.io/kaitai/ksv
```
